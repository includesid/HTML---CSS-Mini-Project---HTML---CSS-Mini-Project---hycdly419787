# About project - *Parallex website* üñ•Ô∏è  
Parallax website is a site in which parallel scrolling technique is used, And this technique is used by by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion. Using parallax scrolling is not a new technique. In the early 1980s, game designers working on Super Mario Bros. used parallax graphics to create a sensation of depth.
